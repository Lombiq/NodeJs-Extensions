# Lombiq Node.js Extensions

[![Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions?label=Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions/)

## About

This project provides several MSBuild-integrated build pipelines - for SCSS and JS files, to copy arbitrary assets to your web root folder, and to lint Markdown files.

`Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions` uses static configuration from your _package.json_ with sensible defaults to free you from managing `npm` packages and scripts yourself.

Also see our [NPM MSBuild Targets](https://github.com/Lombiq/NPM-Targets) library, which this project uses under the hood, and which can make NPM package management in your project a lot easier, too.

Do you want to quickly try out this project and see it in action? Check it out, together with its accompanying [samples](Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions.Samples/Readme.md) [projects](Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions.Samples.NuGet/Readme.md), in our [Open-Source Orchard Core Extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Open-Source-Orchard-Core-Extensions) full Orchard Core solution. You will find our other useful Orchard Core-related open-source projects there, too.

## Pre-requisites

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed for the build to succeed. On Unix-like systems we suggest installing it as user, preferably via the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

This project also makes intensive use of [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), a faster and more efficient package manager, both for package management and script execution.

If you're using `Node.js` 16.9 or later, `pnpm` will be used automatically. With earlier versions of `Node.js` you will need to install `pnpm` version 6 globally by running this command: `npm install pnpm@v6 --global`.

## Installation and usage

This project can be consumed as a `git` submodule or as a `NuGet` package.

### As a Git submodule

In the case of using `Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions` as a git submodule, it is recommended to put it into a folder named _Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions_ under the _src/Utilities_ folder, but you are free to use a different location. You need to add [`Lombiq.Npm.Targets`](https://github.com/Lombiq/NPM-Targets) to the same folder, though.

Then, add a project reference to _Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions/Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions.csproj_ and the following `Import` statements to your project file:

```xml
<!-- At the top: -->
<Import Project="..\..\Utilities\Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions\Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions\Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions.props" />

<!-- At the bottom: -->
<Import Project="..\..\Utilities\Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions\Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions\Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions.targets" />
```

> â“˜ In case you've placed the submodule in a different location or your consuming project is nested deeper, adjust the paths as necessary.

### As a NuGet package

When adding `Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions` as a NuGet package, no further steps are necessary.

### Integration with MSBuild

`Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions` tightly integrates with MSBuild and executes linting, compilation, and minification tasks transparently. In case of warnings or errors during the execution of those tasks, respective MSBuild warnings and errors will be generated and surfaced.

During the first build of your project after adding `Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions`, it will additionally be linked to your project as an `npm` package, which allows you to run the contained `npm` scripts independently of MSBuild. Refer to the [available pipelines](#available-pipelines) section for more information.

## Available pipelines

Here's an overview of the asset pipelines this project makes available:

- [Asset Copying](Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions/Docs/AssetCopying.md)
- [JavaScript](Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions/Docs/JavaScript.md)
- [Markdown](Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions/Docs/Markdown.md)
- [Styles](Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions/Docs/Styles.md)

Please check out our dedicated [Samples](Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions.Samples/Readme.md) project to see the integration in action.

The [NuGet Samples](Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions.Samples.NuGet/Readme.md) project serves as an example of how to use `Lombiq.NodeJs.Extensions` as a NuGet package.

To run the defined scripts in the Visual Studio Task Runner Explorer, please install the [NPM Task Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.NpmTaskRunner64) extension. You can then inspect any errors and linter rule violations directly in the attached console.

### Troubleshooting

You may encounter the following error:

```text
ENOENT: no such file or directory, realpath [...]
```

In this case, please try moving your solution to a folder with a shorter path. Should this not be enough, try to override the `NodeJsExtensionsNpmPackageSourcePath` property with something shorter than the default value of `./node_modules/.nx`. You can try to use `.nx`, but you then need to add _.nx_ to your _.gitignore_ file.

The underlying problem is a too long path name on Windows, and the error appears even when the support for path lengths of over 260 characters has been enabled.
